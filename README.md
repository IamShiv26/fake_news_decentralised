# Fake_news_decentralised

A lot of fake news goes around being circulated in on the Internet these days. This news can be misleading, create false propaganda, disturb communal harmony, affect election results etc. Thus we have created a simple yet powerful solution to prevent propogation and consumption of fake news.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Node packet manager (npm) and nodejs must be installed. 

Web3 package must be installed in the project folder.

### Installing

Download the zip file for the project or clone the repository.
